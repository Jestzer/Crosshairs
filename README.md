# Crosshairs
**Please disable any anti-cheat software before using this, if the software allows you to do so. Using this software can get you banned.**

- Puts a crosshair in the middle of your screen. If it's not appearing, make sure the window isn't minimized.
- Will display on the monitor that you opened the program from.
- You can use the interface window to move the crosshair to your liking.
- Will only work on Windows since it uses WPF. Should work on Windows 7+.
- I've only tested this on 1 computer, so no promises it'll work anywhere else.
